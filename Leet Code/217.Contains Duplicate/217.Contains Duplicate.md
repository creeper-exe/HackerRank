**What is Hashset?**
HashSet is an unordered collection containing unique elements. It has the standard collection operations Add, Remove, Contains

**What is Hashset used for?**
The HashSet class implements the Set interface with hash tables in Java. HashSet is commonly used if you want to access elements randomly or store a list of items which cannot contain duplicate values.

**`set.contains()`**

Set.contains() method is used to check whether a specific element is present in the Set or not. So basically it is used to check if a Set contains any particular element.
